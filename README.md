emayili is a package for sending emails from R. The design goals are:

  - works on all manner of SMTP servers and
  - has minimal dependencies (or dependencies which are easily
    satisfied).

The package name is an adaption of the Zulu word for email, imeyili.

## Installation

At the moment you need to install a specific branch of the `{curl}`
package.

``` r
remotes::install_github("jeroen/curl", ref = "smtp")
```

Then install `{emayili}`.

``` r
remotes::install_github("datawookie/emayili")
```

## Usage

First create a message object.

``` r
library(emayili)
library(dplyr)

email <- envelope()
```

Add addresses for the sender and recipient.

``` r
email <- email %>%
  from("alice@yahoo.com") %>%
  to("bob@google.com") %>%
  cc("craig@google.com")
```

There are also `bcc()` and `reply()` functions for setting the `Bcc` and
`Reply-To` fields.

Add a subject.

``` r
email <- email %>% subject("This is a plain text message!")
```

Add a body.

``` r
email <- email %>% body("Hello!")
```

Add an attachment.

``` r
email <- email %>% attachment("image.jpg")
```

Create a SMTP server object and send the message.

``` r
smtp <- server(host = "smtp.gmail.com",
               port = 465,
               username = "bob@gmail.com",
               password = "bd40ef6d4a9413de9c1318a65cbae5d7")
smtp(email, verbose = TRUE)
```

### Using Gmail

If youâ€™re trying to send email using a Google Mail account, then Google
will most probably flag the attempt to send an email as a security
threat. In order to circumvent this, [grant
access](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) to less
secure apps.
